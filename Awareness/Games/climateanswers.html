    <h3>#1: 11% of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation.</h3>
    <p> This is true. Between 1990 and 2020, the world lost 20 million acres of primary forest. In 2019 and 2020, the world lost 8.9 million acres of tropical forests. Trees capture the GHG that humans create, and also release carbon to the atmosphere when felled, resulting in a general increase in carbon emission.

    <h3> #2: Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019.</h3>
    <p> This incredibly alarming statistic is unfortunately true. The Antartica ice sheet is also melting, at a rate of 148 billion tons of ice PER YEAR. The carbon emissions that we humans release increases the surface temperature of our earth and oceans, which has a detrimental effect on our melting icecaps. Think of the poor polar bears and penguins!

    <h3> #3: The global sea level rose 4 inches in the last century.</h3>
    <p> This statistic is FALSE. The global sea level has risen more than <b><i>8</i></b> inches in the last century. The rate has doubled since the last century, and with all of the melting ice plates, it will only increase more. <br> Source: https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</p><br><br><br>
    
    <h3> #4: The acidity of the ocean has increased by about ___ since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. </h3>
    <p> It has increased about 30% since the Industrial Revolution due to our polluting of the oceans with litter, garbage, factory exhaust, and oil spills. We are poisoning the very fish that we eat, and the ecosystem of the ocean may have been thrown off. <br> Source: https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</p><br><br><br>

    <h3> #5: The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1 degree Farenheit since the late 19th century.</h3>
    <p> This is false. The average surface temperature has actually risen about <b><i>2.12</b></i> degrees Farenheit since the late 19th century. Doesn't seem like much? Well take a look back at the statistic about the ice plates melting. What may only be a minor discomfort too us is disrupting the balance of the world habitat. <br> Source:https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/</p><br><br><br>
