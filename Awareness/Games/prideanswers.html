    <h3>#1: 50 countries have have legalized same-sex marriage.</h3>
    <p> This is false. While we wish it could be true, only 29 countries have legalized same-sex marriage. It is time that we make a push for marriage/civil freedom for all, in all countries.

    <h3> #2: The creator of the rainbow flag was ____. </h3>
    <p> Gilbert Baker! The original Pride flag with eight stripes was created by Baker in 1978 and flew publicly for the first time at the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade celebration on June 25, 1978. Thirty volunteers hand-dyed and stitched the first two pride flags for the parade. The colors represent unique aspects of life, namely: pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for magic and art, indigo for serenity, and violet for spirit.

    <h3> #3: Pride Month is held in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots.</h3>
    <p> This is true! The Stonewall riots were a response to the police raid of the Stonewall Inn in New York Cityâ€™s Greenwich Village, a popular gathering place for the young LGBT community during the early hours of June 28th, 1969. The police arrested employees for selling liquor without a license and roughed up the many patrons inside the inn. As police dragged patrons out of the bar and into police vans, people outside the bar watched and grew increasingly enraged. A riot soon ensued and continued for the next five days. Historians mark the Stonewall riots as a turning point in the gay rights movement, which is why we celebrate it today in June! <br> Source: https://redtri.com/why-is-june-pride-month-in-the-us/</p><br><br><br>
    
    <h3> #4: Pride Month has been officially reocgnized by ___ US presidents. </h3>
    <p> 3 Presidents: Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden! In June 1999, Clinton issued Proclamation No. 7203 for Gay and Lesbian Pride month. He also issued Proclamation No. 13087, which prohibitied discrimination based on sexual orientation, thereby expanding equal rights. In June 2009, Obama issued Proclamation No. 8387 for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Month, once again promoting equal rights. Very recently, Biden declared June the official Pride Month and called for Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ+ people from discrimination.  <br> Source: https://www.loc.gov/law/help/commemorative-observations/pride + https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/biden-recognizes-lgbtq-pride-month-rcna1066.php</p><br><br><br>
