      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to make a single website that will hold all of the information you need to become aware about the issues that plague our time.
      <br><br>
      Education is a communal objective, which is why we've created a way to share useful videos, websites, and information in our user-driven forum. In addition, check out some of the games on the website and use our interactive tool that we hope will spread awareness on all topics, of all kinds.</p>
