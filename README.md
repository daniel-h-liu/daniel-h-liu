Hello! I am Daniel Liu, currently a freshman at Princeton University. I plan on majoring in either Mathematics or Computer Science and getting a minor in the other. Additionally, I plan on getting minors in French Horn Performance and Conducting.

This git repo contains some of the projects I've created over the years, independently, as part of classes, and in hackathons. I included some brief descriptions of each project below, which I hope are helpful.

Feel free to contact me at dhxl2014@gmail.com, or on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-liu-b49903237).

# Project Descriptions

- [Autocomplete Engine](daniel_liu/Autocomplete) - Java

  This project was made as part of my COS226: Data Structures and Algorithm class. I worked with a partner to create an Autocomplete Engine in Java that, given a text file of queries, would predict (and weight) the possible words that the user was trying to type at that second. I included the AutoCompleteGUI.java file, which was provided by my teacher Kevin Wayne, as a more visual way of testing the functionality of the program.
  
- [Awareness Website](daniel_liu/Awareness) - HTML/JS/CSS

  I created this project with a partner during the 24-Hour 2021 TeenHacksLI Spring 2021 Hackathon and it won the Best Use Of Qoom award. Its intent was to demonstrate the concept of an 'awareness hub,' where users could share news and raise awarenesss about whatever topic they wished on a working forum, test their knowledge with quizzes, and play around with interactive images.

- [ID3 Algorithm](daniel_liu/ID3-Algorithm) - Java

  This project was made by a group that I led as part of my high school's AI, Cybersecurity, & Beyond class. It it our implementation of the ID3 algorithm, which calculates entropies and gains of user choices and based on those values, generate decision trees. An online version can be found at: https://replit.com/@dliu22/ID3-Algorithm.
  
- [Pandemic Assistant Website](daniel_liu/Pandemic-App) - Java
  
  Made during the 24-Hour TeenHacksLI Fall 2020 Hackathon in a group of 4, this project aimed to combat the sedentariness brought on by the pandemic by recommending nearby recreational areas that a user could go to to stay active. It is unfortunately no longer functional, as the API keys we used at the time of the website's creation, to access geographical information and perform conversions such as location names to lat-long coordinates, have since expired. This project won 3rd place in the competition.
  
- [Voice-Recognition Pokedex](daniel_liu/VoicePokedex) - JS

  This project was an independent project inspired by the Pokedex from Pokemon, which was a voice-activated encyclopedia of information about different Pokemon. To use this program, speak a Pokemon's name clearly into the computer's microphone, and the program, which uses p5.js to parse spoken word into strings, connects that name to PokeAPI to output relevant information.
