Hello! I am Daniel Liu, currently a sophomore at Princeton University. I plan on majoring in Mathematics or Computer Science and getting a minor in the other. Additionally, I plan on getting minors in French Horn Performance and Conducting.

This git repo contains some of the projects I've created over the years, independently, as part of classes, and in hackathons. I included some brief descriptions of each project below, which I hope are helpful.

Feel free to contact me at dhxl2014@gmail.com, or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-h-liu/).

# Project Descriptions

- *Autocomplete Engine - Java

  This project was made as part of my COS226: Data Structures and Algorithm class. I worked with a partner to create an Autocomplete Engine in Java that, given a text file of queries, would predict (and weight) the possible words that the user was trying to type at that second. I included the AutoCompleteGUI.java file, provided by my teacher Kevin Wayne, as a more visual way of testing the functionality of the program.

- *Seam Carving - Java

  This is an algorithm that can be used to dynamically resize an image with an awareness of its content. by 'carving' removable seams through the photo. Employing dynamic programming to calculate the energy (in terms of color) of the image's pixels, it 'carves' seams through the photo that removes the least-significant pixels to reach a new desired image size. This was made in the same COS226: Data Structures and Algorithms class.

- *2D Nearest Neighbor Search - Java

  This project explores the applications of K-d trees, specifically a 2-D tree that supports range searches and nearest neighbor searches on a 2D grid. Either points or rectangles can be inputted as queries, or the RangeSearchVisualizer.java and NearestNeighborVisualer.java can be used to visually test the program. This was coded with a partner in COS 226: Data Structures and Algorithms.
  
- [Awareness Website](Awareness) - HTML/JS/CSS

  I created this project with a partner during the 24-Hour 2021 TeenHacksLI Spring 2021 Hackathon and it won the Best Use Of Qoom award. Its intent was to demonstrate the concept of an 'awareness hub,' where users could share news and raise awarenesss about whatever topic they wished on a working forum, test their knowledge with quizzes, and play around with interactive images.

- [ID3 Algorithm](ID3-Algorithm) - Java

  This project was made by a group that I led as part of my high school's AI, Cybersecurity, & Beyond class. It it our implementation of the ID3 algorithm, which calculates entropies and gains of user choices and based on those values, generate decision trees. An online version can be found at: https://replit.com/@dliu22/ID3-Algorithm.
  
- [Pandemic Assistant Website](Pandemic-App) - Java
  
  Made during the 24-Hour TeenHacksLI Fall 2020 Hackathon in a group of 4, this project aimed to combat the sedentariness brought on by the pandemic by recommending nearby recreational areas that a user could go to to stay active. It is unfortunately no longer functional, as the API keys we used at the time of the website's creation, to access geographical information and perform conversions such as location names to lat-long coordinates, have since expired. This project won 3rd place in the competition.
  
- [Voice-Recognition Pokedex](VoicePokedex) - JS

  This project was an independent project inspired by the Pokedex from Pokemon, which was a voice-activated encyclopedia of information about different Pokemon. To use this program, speak a Pokemon's name clearly into the computer's microphone, and the program, which uses p5.js to parse spoken word into strings, connects that name to PokeAPI to output relevant information. An online version can be found at: https://voicepokedex.dliu22.repl.co.

*Projects marked with a star cannot be uploaded to a public repository as they were made for a class assignment and it would violate an academic honor code. However, I am more than happy to answer any questions or provide more information about each project.
